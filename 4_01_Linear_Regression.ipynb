Once we know what the data looks like and are satisfied that we have imported it correctly, we will create a forecasting function using regression analysis.  To attempt to measure how well our forecasting function works, we will only use a subset of the ground-truth data for the regression.  This will allow us to measure how well the function forecasts other known data.\n",
